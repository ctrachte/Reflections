How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
- the RC function in Windows was able to instantly compare and find the differences between the two .js files making it fairly easy for me answer the quiz questions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- Quite obviously, if you write code that suddenly breaks your program in an unidentifiable way, the only way to reconcile this would be to revert to a previous working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- Manual saves are excellent and preferable because you can save or commit when a significant change is made. Automatic version control is nice in case you've forgotten to save, but otherwise wasteful, and only available online.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- A repository saves all files each commit because more than likely they are all interconnected and this allows them to be in sync so that particular version will still function.

***QUIZ NOTES - Cloning and Exploring***
ID of commit with revert controls: b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6
 Previous commit to that: f19cb1b80fe27e938e4d72770ca0a42f25e99ecc

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- you can use the command git log to view all the commits made for a repositroy
- you can use git diff to view the differences between commits, like the lines added or removed from the code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- version control through git allows the user to easily revert to previous commits to test and find versions that had bugs. This allows for more confidence.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- when i begin to work on my webpage for the intro to programming course, I will  use it for version control of my webpage
