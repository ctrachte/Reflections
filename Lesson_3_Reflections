When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  1.) You might not always have access to your computer
      a. You might damage or lose your computer, and thus lose your local files
  3.) You might need to access your repository from another location
  4.) You might want others to be able to contribute to your repository
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That would be a terrible idea because if you introduced a bug, Git would push the bug to your master on GitHub.
