When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  1.) You might not always have access to your computer
      a. You might damage or lose your computer, and thus lose your local files
  3.) You might need to access your repository from another location
  4.) You might want others to be able to contribute to your repository
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	That would be a terrible idea because if you introduced a bug, Git would push the bug to your master on GitHub.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks are online copies of a repository on Github seperate from the original contributer. Changes made to the fork will not affect the original.
	A clone is a local copy of a repository
	A branch is a seperate instance of a repository that represents unique changes which the contributer does not want to commit to the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	If someone makes changes to the remote repository that you do not approve of, you still have the last known state saved

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaborating would mostly be harder, you would have to manually save and share local files using flash drives or other online version-control clouds.
    It would still work, just less efficiently, and may not have the best support for code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
